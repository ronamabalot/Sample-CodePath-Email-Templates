Hi{first name},

Thanks for applying to our Facebook backed iOS course for Fall 2018. You have been selected to join the iOS course on campus which will run from August to October 2018.

The iOS for University course features twelve weeks of intense, project-focused iOS training inspired by our professional boot camps and facilitated by CodePath-trained Teaching Assistants. We have had many alumni transition to full-time iOS engineering roles smoothly after completing this program.

1. Classes meet on campus twice a week for two-hour lab and coding sessions every Tuesday and Thursday starting August 3, 2018.

2. Please read the [course policies](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/ios_university/course_overview#heading-course-policies). We have incredibly high expectations of all students participating in this course and will hold everyone accountable to the strict attendance and assignment submission policies.

3. Reach out to the entire [CodePath University community](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/ios_university/course_overview#heading-support-channels).

Be sure to check our [Bootcamp FAQ](http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_ios/thanks_for_applying?id=99#heading-faq) for common questions and feel free to reply to this email if you have any other questions.

We're excited to have you join us! See you soon!
